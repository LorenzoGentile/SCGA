Installation
------------

You can install the released version of SCGA from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
install_github("LorenzoGentile/SCGA")
```

Soon a full descrition of the package will be available <!-- ## Example -->

The software version used for the publication "An optimization approach for designing optimal tracking campaigns for low-resources deep-space missions",IAC2019

is available here:

https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3464039
<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->
<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(SCGA) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
